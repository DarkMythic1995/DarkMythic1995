### Hi there, I'm Maura!

I'm an IT Software Development student at Mid-State Technical College. I'm deeply engaged with my coursework that focuses on creating robust, 
scalable solutions using C#, .NET, and relational databases, with hands-on experience in API integration and data management. Excited about 
applying these skills to develop APIs for Data Science and Engineering, Iâ€™m committed to mastering the technical foundations of software engineering 
to solve real-world problems.

## My Projects

- **Personal Finance and Budget Tracking** (Cross-platform Mobile Application)
  - A cross-platform mobile app developed in .NET MAUI and C# using MVVM design structure, integrating a RESTful API (ASP.NET Core) to manage transactions and budgets.
    Uses SQLite (will be converting to JSON) for local storage and RapidAPI Alpha Vantage for real-time financial data, showcasing my ability to build end-to-end solutions.
  - Skills: C#, .NET MAUI, ASP.NET Core, SQLite, API integration
  - [Finance and Budgeting Mobile Application](https://github.com/DarkMythic1995/personal-finance-tracking-app)
    
- **Medical Insurance Calculator**  
  - A Python-based project using Pandas to process demographic data and calculate insurance costs based on factors such as age, sex, and BMI. Demonstrating data cleaning,
    computational logic, and structured problem-solving.
  - Skills: Python, Pandas, data analysis
